Developed a REST API handling 30–40 req/sec (1,800–2,400 req/min) with JWT authentication, secure profile uploads, Cloudinary-backed CRUD, auction scheduling, bid increments, and seller-only deletion. – Built a React.js frontend featuring Framer Motion animations, brand filters, live countdowns, image carousels, search dropdowns, and auth-locked modals which support 500–1,000 concurrent auctions at a latency <200 ms. – Architected dual-channel Socket.io streams (global per-item) to fan out 50–100 bid-update messages/sec to ≈50 clients without dropped frames, enabling instant outbid alerts and win notifications.
